# Personal Website

This is my what will become my personal website.

The goal is to have the entire website be small and entirely
self-hosted/under my control.

## Semantic and Speed

The website should convey everything I want; all whilst remaining
semantic, accessable, and snappy.

## To Do

- Core CSS
- HTML
- Validation of HTML
- Liquid Layout
- Speed testing and improvements

## Additional Work

A fancy CV/about me boilerplater.

A blog with RSS

A Git repository page (linked to self-hosted git)
