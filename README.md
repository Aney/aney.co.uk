# Personal Website

This is my what will become my personal website.

The goal is to have the entire website be small and entirely
self-hosted/under my control.

## Semantic and Speed

The website should convey everything I want; all whilst remaining
semantic, accessable, and snappy.

## To Do

- Finalise Content
- Misc page
 - This will contain links to other pages not in the header
- Support page
- A blog with RSS

## Release Notes

- Add 'tags' to easily show skills
- Remove files from the files/ directory
- Remove Wiki
- Add robots.txt, and .gitignore
