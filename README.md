# Personal Website

This is my what will become my personal website.

Since I haven't worked with web or design in a few years I've decided
to create this, but with a focus on content rather than "design".

## Semantic and Speed

My goal for this is to convey everything I want; all whilst keeping
the website semantic, accessable, and snappy

## To Do

- Core CSS
- HTML
- Validation of HTML
- Liquid Layout
- Speed testing and improvements
- Scripts for blog, page building, etc
- Scripts for CSS
- Make more appealing

## Additional Work

A fancy CV/about me boilerplater.

This could however be made into a seperate project for other's use

A blog and RSS system

Again, this may be made into a seperate modular project and added onto the site

### Will take a while

Like all things I work on, this will likely take a hot minute to complete.

Not due to complexity, but work, home life, and then the  unhealthy use of PCs.
