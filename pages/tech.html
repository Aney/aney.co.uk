					<h3>Laptop - Thinkpad X200</h3>
					<p>I bought my Thinkpad in June 2020, 12 years after it was released. This was bought to switch to from my Macbook Air 2015 7,2.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Debian</p></li>
						<li><p>Core 2 Duo P8600</p></li>
						<li><p>4GB DDR3 RAM</p></li>
						<li><p>250GB SSD</p></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>PC</h3>
					<p>My PC was intended to be sold once I got the Thinkpad, as that was to be my every-day driver. I am currently still in possesion of it however, for gaming with friends.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Windows 10</p></li>
						<li><p>Ryzen 5 2600X</p></li>
						<li><p>16GB DDR4 RAM</p></li>
						<li><p>512GB EVO 970 NVME<p></li>

						<li><p>1TB HDD</p></li>
						<li><p>Vega 64</p></li>
					</ul>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Microphone - Blue Yeti</h3>
					<p>It's good, and it's cheap. I also use a microphone arm with it, and have thrown out the stand. Oop.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Peripherals</h3>
					<p>The other stuff I use with my laptop/PC</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Thinkpad Dock</p></li>
						<li><p>Razer Blackwidow Lite, Keyboard</p></li>
						<li><p>Logitech MX Master, Wireless Mouse</p></li>
						<li><p>BENQ Monitor. 1600x900, with a monitor stand.</p></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Phone</h3>
					<p>I used a Huawei P8 Lite 2017. This is purely because it was cheap, and I could afford it. As long as a phone is usable, can be used as a hotspot, and has a solid battery life, that's good for me.</p>

				<h2><a id="software" class="anchor">Software</a></h2>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Operating System - Debian</h3>
					<p>Currently I'm running Debian 10 Buster on my daily driver. I went with a minimal install, and try to only include what I need.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Window Manager - dwm</h3>
					<p>My current window manger is DWM, a tiling wm. It's lightweight, and once you get used to it, it feels better to use than a traditional wm</p>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Terminal - st</h3>
					<p>I use st, with a couple of custom keybinds and a gruvbox theme. I use this along with my shell of choice, zsh.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Browser - Brave</h3>
					<p>This was a tie between ungoogled-chromium and Brave. I opted for Brave due to the BAT tokens.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Music, Video, and Images</h3>
					<p>I use cmus for music, mpv for video, and feh for images. However, these are rarely used as I've been using Youtube for most consumption.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>News and Downloads</h3>
					<p>I use newsboat for my rss feeds, and youtube-dl with mpv to watch videos from my feed. I also use transmission for anime downloads.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Email - Gmail</h3>
					<p>I've not setup an alternative for Gmail yet, so I'm still using Gmail for my emails. I also make use of Google Drive, but have been looking at alternatives.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="item">
					<h3>Other</h3>
					<p>For pretty much everything else I use, I recommend looking at my install script (that likely isn't finished/working) <a href="https://github.com/Aney/scripts/blob/master/install.sh">here</a></p>
