				<h2>I'm Aney.</h2>
				<p>A self-proclaimed waste, working on becoming an essentialist; and with that learning to use the PC to improve, and create an efficient workflow for my everyday life. </p>

				<h2>I've been working towards simple living</h2>
				<p>As around three years ago I realised I had far too much stuff, and it was causing lots of hidden stress. I took charge and cleared around 70 t-shirts from my wardrobe, and felt immediately better. After this I reduced my wallet's contents, and then stumbled accross Minimalism Youtube that I used to edumikate myself.</p>

				<h2>My goal is to be F.I. and self sufficient</h2>
				<p>So that I can live without the need of other outside sources, and more importantly, big corporations.</p>
