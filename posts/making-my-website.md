I decided that I wanted to be platform independant, with no-one pulling the strings on what I could, or couldn't say/do.

I'd been easing off the greater web for a while, but kept coming back for some reason or another. Most of the time being to check up on someone, or something; To see if there were any cools videos, etc.

My domain name had been sitting vacant for quite some time, and after some *woke* content from a few youtubers, and blogs I was reading at the time. I decided to start up again.

# Starting out

I've built websites before, and I was pretty good at making visually appealing websites with CSS. I wanted to focus more on content this time around, like the web should be focussed on. 

From this decision I built a website with a slight focus on semantic markup, as it was a pre-release after all. This site was highly influenced by the design of lukesmith.xyz, you can see that itteration of the site (here)[#link]. I then took it upon myself to research a little about semantic markup, good minimal css practises, and stumble upon *web bloat*, which made me double down on the decision to make a content focussed, small, easily accessible site.

For example, I want as many people to be able to access and browse my website as possible, regardless of where they live, what their internet is like, and such.
