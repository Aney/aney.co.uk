				<h2>I'm Aney</h2>
				<p>Somehow you've landed on my website, welcome!</p>
				<h3>What this, then?</h3>
				<p>It's my little place on the world wide web. It serves the purpose of being a one-stop location I can refer people to when they ask things, like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Who are you?</a></li>
					<li><a href="equipment.html">What hardware do you use?</a></li>
					<li>How about software?</a></li>
					<li>What's in your onebag?</a></li>
					<li>Why does your website look like that?</li>
					<li>Anime recommendations?</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Where are the pictures?</h3>
				<p>I've written this website with the intention to keep it minimal, quick, small, and easily self-hosted. I decided that there was little reason to bloat the pages with images, that add little value, as all they will do is prevent people with poor internet from visiting.</p>
