				<h2>My everyday tech</h2>
				<p>This is what I use basically every day. It's either at my desk, in my bag, or within arms reach.</p>

				<section id="pc">
					<h3>Laptop - Thinkpad x220</h3>
					<p>My everyday driver is a Thinkpad x220, specced with an i5 2540m, 6GB RAM, and a 500GB EVO 860 mSata SSD. It typically runs Debian with dwm, but since I've been having problems with my arm, it's been running Pop!_OS like a champ.</p>
					<p>I use this laptop for practically everything, and it performs well for my use-cases whether docked at my desk, or standalone for travels.</p>
					<h4>X220 Docking Station</h4>
					<p>When I'm at home, I typically stay docked to this station as it has all my ports pre-plugged, and an additional 500GB HDD (which I don't use). This makes it easy to switch between working at the desk, and lounging on the seatee/bed.</p>

				<h2>Gaming PC</h2>
				<p>Red, a custom built machine sporting an R5 2600X, 16GB RAM, a 500GB EVO 970 NVME, and a Vega 64. This is my only device running Windows.</p>
				<p>I don't use this anywhere near as much as I used to, but when I want to play a game I've got this PC that I know will perform, regardless of the title.</p>
				<p>I am heavily considering selling it when the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steamdeck</a> releases, however.</p>

				<h2>Media Consumption</h2>
				<section id="tv">
					<h3>TV</h3>
					<p>A basic non-smart TV from years back. I got it for my 16th Birthday, 10 years ago.</p>
					<h4>Fire TV Stick 4K</h4>
					<p>Since my TV is useless alone, and I don't watch traditional television, this is plugged in to give me access to Netflix, Amazon Video, Crunchyroll, and Jellyfin.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="music">
					<h3>Amazon Echo 3</h3>
					<p>I don't use this for anything other than playing music. It stays next to the TV waiting for me to say "Alexa, play <a href="https://youtu.be/6Zbi0XmGtMw?t=27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We like to party, by the Vengaboys</a>."
				</section>

			<section id="servers">
				<h2>Servers</h2>
				<section>
					<h3>lilman</h3>
					<p>An HP 290 G1 MT, with an i5-7500, and 8GB RAM. This is my primary server, although I've still yet to get around to migrating services from rpi3.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>rpi3</h3>
					<p>A Raspberry Pi 3B+ that's running my webserver, and gitserver, alongside a few docker containers. It's a pretty swell device, and I may very well start a cluster with it when I get the chance.</p>
				</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Unused/Spares</h2>
				<p>I go through hoarding phases unfortunately, so besides what I've listed, I also have; 5 other PCs of various specs, a 1U server, 4 more laptops (3 of which are Thinkpads), and a RPI 3B. Out of these, I intend to keep two PCs, the 3 thinkpads, and the RPI3.</p>
